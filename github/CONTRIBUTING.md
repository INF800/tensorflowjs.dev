The following are a set of guidelines to follow when contributing to this project.

## Code Of Conduct

This project adheres to the TFJS Dev [code of conduct](../CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating,
you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior to
[tfjs.dev@gmail.com](mailto:tfjs.dev@gmail.com).

## Have A Question?

consensus around project direction and issue solutions within issue threads
(when appropriate).

All submissions should come in the form of pull requests and need to be reviewed
by project committers. Read [GitHub's pull request documentation](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/)

## From Contributor To Committer

We love contributions from our community! If you'd like to go a step beyond contributor
and become a committer with full write access and a say in the project, contact us and 
get invited to the projet. The existing committers employ an internal nomination
process that must reach lazy consensus (silence is approval) before invitations
are issued. If you feel you are qualified and want to get more deeply involved,
feel free to reach out to existing committers to have a conversation about that.

## Security Issues

Security issues shouldn't be reported on this issue tracker. Instead, [file an issue to our security experts](mailto: tfjs.dev@gmail.com).
